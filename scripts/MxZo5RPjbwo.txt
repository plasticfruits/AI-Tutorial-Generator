[Music] so we got a call from Thomas anytime anybody calls in and says they have a problem with the draft the first thing I do go to the house and I look at this back wall back here what are you looking at so you can see how this particular area the suit is all burnt off all right so the clear color stone yeah no soot set up atop was its value so that tells me that the fireplace is operating correctly because most of the heat is supposed to be down here that's why you have that burn the way you do in that area so I know this fireplace is working great so much heat that is actually burning to sit off that's right okay and we'd like to heat obviously because that's creating the hot air which is we hope will go up the chimney that's right so basic principle of physics hot air goes up behind this stone we have a couple components that we build a smoke shelf smoke chamber we make that into like a cone that meets at the bottom of the flue and that's where the smoke goes up and out of the house once we have a proper draught we know the fireplace is working well so if someone still has this hue back here that we see but they still have smoke coming back we know that they've probably built the fire incorrectly so you're thinking maybe technique all right well let's see your technique for build all right fire so the first thing we're gonna do is add newspaper all I'm gonna do is crumpled it up loosely stuff it under the grate I'm not going to worry about putting too much paper in because it's just going to burn but I do want to leave enough room for the flames to catch second thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get my biggest logs and I'm gonna lay them the long way and the great like this I'm gonna leave a space in between the logs just so the flame can bump up now I'm gonna take my medium logs and just crisscross the big logs like this again I'm gonna leave a gap in between the firewood and the last thing I'm gonna do is take my kindling which I get in the backyard as well and I'm just gonna throw it on top of my second layer of firewood just like this so most people are probably putting a kinder down low so what I find is when you put the kindling down low which is what most people do you light the newspaper and the newspaper flame can't get up through that kindling so that's when it gets stuffed and the smoke starts to emanate into the room so what I want to do before I light the fire is I want to prime the flue you can see it's already starting to pull smoke up it's a priming it meaning you're trying to get a little bit of heat moving through that chimney that's right and that's gonna let everything else go the same way mm-hmm so I'm just late for that I'll go about half way and once I'm at about this point all I'm gonna do is dip down to my newspaper kind of ignite it and then I'll just put that on top but you can see the flames being pulled up that's because we primed the flue not just pulled up but you can see actually the flames coming off the paper going right between the big ones right right between the medium ones and you hear that crackle that means we're getting some effect on the kindling I can feel the heat out here but no smoke yeah all right and you've got sort of a very tall upright flame telling you that's airflow so that's air flow and again that means all my mechanics inside were built properly because the flue is lined up directly with the center of our fireplace and as you can see that flame is being pulled right into the center so and another thing we should add is that hardwood seasoned wood is always the best to use you know some people you don't ever want to use pine pine can create some of that creosote that everybody is so afraid of all right I think you proved your point mark we got about a half hour into this fire I got a good burn no smoke in the room no smoke and we were actually able to add a couple logs so if you use this method of lighting a fire nine times out of 10 you're going to be great if you do have that oddity where the smoke comes back into the room you probably have some kind of blockage or maybe the chimney isn't built high enough so might be time to call the local mason at that time good information thanks for the fire all right thanks Kevin thanks for watching this whole house has got a video for just about every home-improvement project so be sure to check out the others and if you'd like we can see click on the subscribe button make sure that you get our newest videos writing your feed
