fire-making in the 18th century was an essential task for common people it's a skill that almost everybody was going to have so today we're going to start a couple little fires with the with the items that come and our fire starting kit so we're gonna need a few things to get started making our fire with today we're going to need a striker I'm going to need a good piece of sharp flint we're going to need a piece of char cloth we use this as our tinder this will catch the spark that comes off of our striker then we're going to need a little bit of very very very fine kindling and here I've got some of the jute that we include in our fire-making kit this jute comes as cordage that you have to tease into a bird's nest we'll also need some other things some larger kindling some sticks of varying sizes maybe even some dried grass or something like that for the later stages so there's three principal steps here and getting our fire going we need to make a spark we need to catch that spark and then we need to take that spark and blow it into flame what we're going to do to get our spark so we're going to have to use our striker and our Flint and we have to drive metal shavings off of this striker to get a good hot spark I'm going to take our little piece of char cloth and I'm gonna lay it up on top of our piece of Flint here there's a little spot going we can see that it's glowing red there we can take this little piece we can set it inside of our bird's nest we don't need a giant bird's nest and it bursts right into flame so it's very easy we put that in our brazier here and then we can put our larger pieces of kindling and on top of it you have a nice little fire going there are also some other items that we have available on the fire making page of the catalog one of the other items that's available is the tobacco box with fire starting lens to help you start fires and it's big enough to use as a tinderbox also so you could not necessarily use that for tobacco but actually put your striker and other items inside this tin so there's a you know more than one way to start a fire we have tinder fungus and tinder fungus is an item that you would use like char cloth it is actually a tree fungus that grows in northern climates and it is so fine that it can that the spark can actually catch on it and burn right away so it doesn't have to be preached hard to use it to start fires it takes a little bit more skill so that's something that you'd need to experiment with all these fire making items and this brazier they're available on our website or in our print catalog and don't forget to follow us on Facebook you
