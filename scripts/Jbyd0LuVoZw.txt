this is what we're looking for it's a paper buck now there are lots of them around here but it's this particular feature there's what we're after this bulge and this may indicate that this tree contains water there's only one way to find out and that's to cut into there that's incredible it's even quite sweet now that's safe water because the tree itself has filtered all the impurities and bacteria out of it for Aborigines fire is an important tool and for more than just cooking matches are easy to come by but Michael an elder of Jebel Bell still knows how to make nature's secret phone Michael how old were you when you first learn this to me Mariupol ER or Meyer who lived in the will of Allah Marwan was well I didn't know he was about 60 wth first he flattens the stick to make a half drills in a hollow and carves a notch into it a stick of the same wood twirled into the hollow causes a hot dust to spew out of the knotch it's hot enough to make fire the Jordan today may have trouble lighting fire the old way but they certainly know what to do with it there you go this may look like the young pyromaniacs club but Aborigines encourage their children to set fires from an early age it's the end of the rainy season the ground is wet and heavy Jews will damp down these patches of fire each morning because the land is burned regularly the fires move quickly just clearing out the dense scrub on the forest floor but leaving big trees alive and still standing for the Aborigines this technique has many benefits it may look destructive but it's not it's actually essential for regenerating plant life the succulent new growths are going to entice games such as Wallabies into this area and with the dead vegetation burned away hunting becomes much easier it's a debatable technique but the fires are also active signals outstations are widely scattered over this vast landscape an Aborigines travel miles from their homes to hunt and gather plants the plumes of smoke identified just who's working where and that helps to prevent any one area from being hunted out
