[Music] hi I'm Luke Williams and today I'm gonna show you how to start a fire using the bow drill method now in your backpack or EDC or whatever you carry through the woods with you you should always have some type of fire starting material for me I like to keep Vic lighters because they last a long time and they're cheap to buy if you find yourself in the woods without any of these then this is a great method to get a fire started now all you need for this is a knife and a shoestring however today I've got a few extra things to kind of help ease the process I have my hatchet I'm a multi-tool my pocketknife and then a pair of boots with some shoe strings on them now you don't need all of that you can just do this with a knife but if you have all these other tools it's gonna be a lot easier now before we get started you need to find the right type of wood a lot of people are gonna say soft hardwoods a lot of people will say hard soft woods however what I like to use is a soft wood and it is this right here it's the beautiful cedar you found these all over my area so it's easy to find and they've always worked very well for me but you need to go ahead and do some research in your area see what's around and see what's readily available should you ever have to do this in an emergency situation for now go out and try to find me a Down cedar get it cut up and ready to use and make some fire [Music] all right this is the tree I think I'm gonna use has been down a little while looks like it's gonna be nice and draw first thing I'm gonna do is go ahead and cut me a long sliver about an inch thick this will be for my fire board and I'm gonna want it to be about eight or ten inches long get around six inches wide you want to make sure it's straight and relatively smooth alright so as you can tell cutting up the fire board is no easy task and if all you have is a knife then you probably want to find a smaller piece that you can whittle out instead of chunking out a tree like I do with the hatchet but now that we have this done we're gonna go find our drill for that all we need is a stick about eight inches long and a half inch to an inch thick and for this we want to make sure it's totally straight it doesn't have any kinks in it at all otherwise your drills not going to turn straight so let's go over and find one I'd knowed that right across the little trail right here I saw another little down cedar tree so we're gonna go cut it up and bring it on over and get it smooth and whittled down and then after we get it whittled down and smooth around the edges we're gonna go ahead and sharpen out one side of it on the other side we're gonna round the end of it the next thing we're going to need to find is a bow and any type of wood will work for this simply tie your line around the two sides making a bow all right now that we've got our fire board our drill and our bow and I'm soaking wet and sweat we've only got one more thing to get and that's our handhold for this there's a number of things you can use depending on what area you're in you can use a Hickory Nut you could use a shell or a rock alright now that we have all our components the next thing we're going to do is we're gonna use our knife and we're going to go ahead and create a divot in our fire board and that needs to be about an inch from the outside once we have that divot right there we're gonna go ahead and take our bow and our drill put your drill against it with the rounded on this side and we're gonna go ahead and start drilling this down we don't want to go too far we just want to go ahead and get it seated alright now that we got the bow seated in the fire board we're gonna go ahead and use the salt on our multi-tool and cut out a little area for the ashes to fall down underneath the fire board alright now we've got everything ready to make fire we're gonna go out and find some bark we're gonna put that piece of bark underneath our fire board to catch our ashes which will turn into coal and then we're gonna get some tinder go ahead and ball that up and get that ready to dump all the coal on from the bar all right well my hand hold I had was not working very well I thought I had enough of a divot for the for the drill to stay on it but it didn't so went out and feeling some more this one right here I feel like it's gonna be the one it's got a nice clean divot inside of it I think this is gonna get us going we're gonna get rid of this one [Music] alright guys like I said this is a great and efficient fire-starting method however it's not gonna be easy as you can tell by all the sweat I mean it is 130 degrees today in Tennessee but it's not that bad to make and go ahead and get your fire going with this know there's a lot of tips and tricks ask your buddies your friends do some research the one thing I will tell you is make sure you keep your bowline low in your drill when you're drilling that's gonna make sure that your drill stays inside of your hand hold a lot easier god I want to know whether tips you have let me know in the comments below and then make sure you head to radar it's a YouTube channel and hit subscribe from the farm I'm Luke Williams gonna put this fire up to this high as hell today in Tennessee Oh [Music]
