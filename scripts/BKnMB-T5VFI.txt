[Intro Plays] What's up everybody, welcome back to my laboratory where safety is #1 priority. And today, I'm going to to show you how to start a fire with just 2 sticks Just by rubbing them together. Kids, do NOT try this at home, ask for adult supervision Okay, lets check this out. First I'm going to grab a couple of dried sticks, I'm going to break it BOOM That will do, just like that Then I'm going to have to split it. BOOM Just like that. Machete in survival situation is pretty good. Yup, it feels pretty dry And right here what I'm going to do is carve it out Then I'm going to grab another stick, and then I'm going to make it pointy. It's also VERY dry stick BOOM Then I'm going to go at the angle like this Now I just have to carve it out to where its much tinier over here. Okay, that looks pretty good to me. Okay, then we are going to drive it into the dirt a little bit, so it does not move as much. Then we are going to grab another stick, you see how it's pointy right here and flat And right here we carved out a line and we are just going to go like this. Look how much smoke there is! Nice, then I'm going to drop it into some kind of candling Look at that smoking. And just wave it a little bit Whoa! Finally! There you go! Wow! And we got fire. That's Awesome. Look at that. But now you know that to do next, just add a little twigs and you got yourself survival fire. Alright guys, that's pretty much it I think it's really hard to start a fire with two sticks, so you would have to practice at home... ...and kinda learn that skill. When you actually have to use this kind of trick it will be a lot easier But, I'll tell you one thing for sure: it is really, really hard to start a fire with just two sticks. But it is possible, it's just you will burn a lot of energy, that's for sure. Alright guys that's pretty much it, don't forget to give this video a thumbs up, and I'll see you next time.
