what's up guys primal here with max tactical in the warrior tribe today we're going to show you how to start fire with the Fresnel lens don't go anywhere so when it comes to fire-starting i like to go by the rule of threes which means i like to have three methods of starting fire or at least the knowledge to know how to make fire three different ways so ideally I've got about three actual ways of starting fire by combustion or you know Ferro rod or a lighter or things of that nature but there's also other main means of making fire such as primitive skills such as a bow drill or hand drill fire and everything like that but today we're talking about sun magnification and I wanted to show you guys how the star fire with this Fresnel lens here it's a pretty standard lens you can get it just about anywhere it's really really lightweight it's you know you can't even notice it it's small it fits in your wallet or fit in a pack so it's a really good backup method of fire starting and it takes you know no real resources all you're going to have is this lens a good bright sunny day you know you want to do this on a day when it's you know really really sunny out no clouds or anything like that and ideally you know there's a right time of day to it - typically about between you know 12 and 112 and - when the Sun is at its highest peak in the sky that's ideally when you want to try to do this so what we're going to do is take this lens and I like this I like to do it with some sticks here and you can either get a big long stick like this or you can do a smaller Y shape or you could do a bigger y shaped it doesn't really matter just whatever you've got in your area as far as resources goes so you can do a wide shape stick or a standard straight stick and what you're going to do is cut two slits on the left and right side of the wire just one right down the middle of the big one and you're just going to take your lens and slide it right into that slit and this is going to give you some leverage and it's going to be able you're going to be able to hold this a lot more steady than you were would be able to if you were to just try to hold the lens by itself and what you can also do sharp at the end and stab it into the ground and I'll show you guys how we can use that to angle it and get there to get the the proper pitch to get the right amount of sunlight in the right place so again you know if you wanted to use the wide shape stick you just cut your slits and and you can slide your lens right down in there and use it just like that so what we need to do now is get a good tinder bundle alright guys so we got our tinder bundle right here and this is just a lot of dried grass and you want to just basically bird's nest it up there really break it down and get those really fibrous pieces in there and then you want to take your lens here now if you'll notice what you got to do is really concentrate on getting this light in the right spot so if you'll notice right here on the dirt I've got the lens at an angle to where it's pretty much just a big giant square you'll notice as I move closer that box focuses down into a solid beam of light and that right there is what you want you want it to be pretty much a small little circle of pure white light because that's when it's at its its hottest and most focused point so that's exactly what you want to do see you'll notice as I'm out here it's bigger as I go even closer it'll get bigger again so you got to find the right the right angle there to where it's just the right amount of light focused in the right spot so you can take your stick and you can stab it into the ground and you can get the right angle out of it and once you get it you just leave it there and you might want to adjust your tinder bundle if you need to but ideally you just want to get that right line I've done it both ways sometimes I'll stab it in the ground and sometimes I'll just hold it but that's the good thing about having a stick like this is it makes it a lot easier to hold and control to get the right amount of light in the right spot so what we're going to do is just find that right spot right here on our tinder bundle and it might take some time this can be a frustrating process but all you got to do is just keep at it and you will get it so we're just going to focus that beam right dead on it and as you can see it starts smoking really really fast and that's what you want basically you just want to keep working it around in that spot and it's going to build up a hotspot so as it continues to smoke and continues to smoke if you notice it doesn't catch fire or anything really fast sometimes this will happen quick sometimes it'll take a minute a lot of it depends upon your tinder - this is pretty much ideal tinder for this particular type of fire starting so we're just going to let that continue to build and we'll slightly move the the light around a little bit to continue widening the hotspot and what this is going to do essentially if it takes a while it's going to build up some coals or at least a pile of coals if you will and hopefully with the with a little bit of wind or you can blow on it bellow that up a little bit and it will it just ignite kind of out of nowhere so like I said this can take a little time don't get frustrated with it you might have to adjust a couple different times to get it right where you need it to be it's all about keeping that light right in the right spot keeping it focused it's really easy to let it get out of focus it's one thing I like about having this stick is it lets you keep it really focused a lot easier if you were to just try to hold the lens itself it gets a lot easier a lot harder you get a lot more movement there you have so like I said guys it can take a little time but with a little patience and a little practice you can get a good Sun magnification fire alright guys so that's how you start fire via sun magnification through the Fresnel lens there's tons of different lenses out there that you can use you can use a water bottle you can use a plastic bag with your own pee you can even use a piece of ice to do some magnification fire so I encourage you guys to take the initiative and go out there and get hands-on and learn these things I'm going to be doing some more demonstration videos on these techniques in future videos so as always guys please remember to like drop me a comment below and subscribe to the channel if you enjoy our videos and want to see them as soon as they get put up so if you're looking to take your survivability to the next level guys please check us out at the website at mash tactical comm and join our warrior tribe our warrior tribe is making a difference in the lives of others worldwide dramatically we are changing people's lives and we are actively saving them through the things that we do our tribe avidly focuses on how to increase our survivability in every aspect so we do challenges every month we we do all kinds of different things to help you increase your survivability so please guys check it out and get involved and we'll see you guys in the next video you
