being prepared with everything that we do can help us so we're going to talk about the fire triangle to start with that is what makes a fire okay so we have got air which is all around us we've got a ignition source which will come on to it a little bit later on okay and we've got fuel the fuel itself can be broken down into three main parts so we've got our cinder here the tinder takes our ignition source and turned it into a flame from there we've got kindling kindling is map stick to some thickness sized pieces of woods state and then we've got our main fuel main fuel is thumb size thickness upwards really I'm not going to keep your fire burning for a longer period of time so it's been out we've collected our wood we now need to turn it into what we've got in front of us we need to make fire before we can do that when you think of a couple of things so site selection got a shelter there we want the benefit of this heat into that shelter so it needs to be relatively close but not too close from there we need to think about the actual ground itself clearing everything back so it's nice clean mud that's going to insulate the fire from the damp from the floor okay and also from the from the cold as well helping us to increase the heat and ultimately that fire triangle from there we're going to take our ignition source so in this case a frozen rod Sparky stick we're going to spark into some cotton wool with a little bit of vaseline in there as well the Vaseline is going to increase the burn time from now we're going to add on our feather sticks those sticks that we shave down to give them a nice big surface area increasing the airflow we'll put them on we'll let them catch and then we'll start adding smaller pieces of sticks okay so your kindling more kindling keep on going up to thumb size thickness from there we're then going to go on to a bigger wood so from thumb size thickness upwards okay and the idea of that vent you're increasing the amount of wood that's going on the fire all the time but not too much we don't want to smother it we don't want to break that fire triangles down from there really the sky's your limit so we want to move on to wrist size thickness 5 size thickness and keep adding to the to the flame increasing that end of that that's going to give you a nice fire burn for a long period of time and keep you warm throughout the night so now our fire is burning we building our water made some coffee I've got light I've got heat morale is good I can sit here I can look at the fire safe that I'm going to warm tonight
