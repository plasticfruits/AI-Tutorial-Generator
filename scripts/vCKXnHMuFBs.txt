[Applause] what's going on doggies welcome back to another video all right today i want to teach you three ways how to start a fire without using lighters or matches it's super effective it's really fun so let's dive straight into it so this is the first and my favorite way how to start a fire all you need is a battery and a chocolate so the reason why this is my favorite way to start a fire is because you get to eat chocolate so we don't actually want the chocolate what we want if we want this this foil by far the best way to start fire so there's two main things you need to start this fire one is some sort of a dry material a dry tinder so i've just found this coconut husk over there on the beach which is absolutely perfect and i've gone and collected a little bit of dry grass from just up the back there so we'll take our delicious chocolate wrapper and we'll just rip off a section of this foil you want to rip a little bit out of the inside like this and we'll repeat that on the other side so we're left with a piece of foil from that chocolate which looks like that take the paper from your kitkat wrapper and just rip off a small section something like this we're going to wrap that paper around this foil that we've cut out all right we're just going to connect the two terminals together using this piece of foil and it should go up should start smoking fairly quickly oh no my kitkat wrap is coming undone but there you go you can see it's smoking already she's smoking look at that so that's getting really hot now that's good this is perfect so now we're going to get our tinder she's really going up yeah look at that that is a beautiful thing so just place this in here [Music] now we can just keep growing to this tinder pile we wrap it in our grass and boom just like that we have fire that's a very nice way to make fire out of a battery look at that and the second way we're gonna start this fire is with this a plain bottle of water believe it or not you can actually start a fire with a bottle of water exactly like this all you need is a bottle of water and some super dry tinder now this look at the winds just carrying that away that's a really really dry tinder we're going to use this bottle as a magnifying glass and you're just going to concentrate it maybe if you push him down a little bit we're going to concentrate it on that section there now this doesn't take too long usually if you've got a really dry tinder so we'll just hold him there you got to be patient oh it's starting to smoke you can see that smoke there look at this it's starting it's going it's going see it turning color look at that it's smoking so as you can see there that's actually there's an ember built up inside here so now you it's very important to add to the top of the pile oh this is beautiful we've got a really good ember going on here so we'll grab our coconut husk we'll place our coconut husk on top make sure the ember goes on the coconut husk look at this guys and we repeat like we did before so wrap it in our grass [Music] look at this oh oh it's smoky and boom just like that we have fire from a bottle of water about to melt my camera so there you go we just started fire with a bottle of water and it took about how long did that take 20 seconds 30 seconds but the key to doing that is the dry material 100 if you've got dry material you can pretty much start a fire anywhere as long as you've got sun first time i ever did that i did it around a campfire i wasn't a campfire so it was down the beach we were fishing and the guys that i was with were absolutely mind blown i should have put money on it anyway so the third way we're gonna start a fire is with this plastic bag it's actually a ziploc bag i carry these in my backpack all the time when i do big tracks fishing so i can take the fish fillets back so these always stay in my bag and it's a really easy way to start a fire as well fill him up it's also very important that you have if your water is like the clearest it can be it's going to start a fire a lot easier so you want something that looks very similar to that you're just going to pinch and twist this without popping it i've only got one of these bags so i can't pop it so this round shape here that's what you want that's what's going to magnify the sun as it comes through the bag of water the reason that it starts so easy is because this is so dry it's very important all right we're going to find our point so usually i have i have a lot more success with a plastic bag than a bottle so look at this that's already starting to smoke you can see the color change there look at this that is unbelievable so just like the bottle of water it works exactly the same we've got our ember that is pro i actually surprised myself just then that's probably the quickest i've ever done it that was not long at all but then again it's a very hot day and i'm using extremely good materials so sometimes what'll happen it'll get stuck in the coconut there so we can maybe try transferring it hey yeah yeah maybe we can try transferring it just straight to this will blow all right so now we've got a little bit of a light on there transfer it to our bigger pile i don't have a lot of um dry grass left so i'm going to wrap it in this kitkat wrapper comes in handy again it's pretty much all the dry grass i've got that's going to do nothing there we go starting fire with a bag of water so there you go three ways of starting a fire without using matches the most important thing to remember is if the tinder's dry you'll pretty much start a fire every single time doing that it's got to be dry tinder all right guys as always thank you so much for watching make sure you smash that subscribe button if you want to see
