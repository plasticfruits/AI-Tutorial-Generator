hi everyone this is at ham early from NJ renewable energy today I'm gonna do a little experiment I guess it's almost a Survival Guide type experiment to show you what you could do if you're ever in need of a fire and don't have matches or a lighter but the bigger picture here is the capability of the Sun and I think at times we forget how powerful it is and what I'm going to show you what this experiment is essentially the amount of Sun that's hitting my hand is is capable of doing some pretty amazing things and just for the record today is the 20th of December so we're one day away from being the shortest day of the year so even though the Sun is at the lowest amount angle it could pilot will possibly be here in New Jersey and the days are shorter I'm still able to do these do this experiment under these conditions so you can only imagine if it was hotter and summertime and the Sun was at a at a higher angle so here we go so here's your everyday water bottle I've removed the plastic sticker around the outside and it's no coincidence that the piece of paper I'm going to use to focus my light energy on is black this is because we want to absorb the sunlight and not reflect it away if you've done a good job focusing the light you'll see smoke rather quickly as the paper begins to burn I move the focus light over ever so slightly to continue till heat up new paper in less than a minute I already have a burning spot large enough where I'm going to start thinking about covering it with some additional paper by adding the paper will we will of course be adding some additional fuel but more importantly in the short term were using it to trap heat at this point adding additional air will help increase the intensity of the smoldering paper and again we continue to add more paper which is more fuel and trapping more heat at this point it's obvious we've turned the corner and extend success is only moments away and there's fire that's exactly what this thing is doing right there this does about 80% of our hot water just from the Sun our Sun provides enough energy in one minute to supply the world's energy needs for one year in one day it provides more energy than our current population with you soon in 27 years in fact the amount of solar radiation striking the earth over a three-day period is equivalent to the energy stored in all fossil energy sources want to learn more about renewable energy and sustainability contact me @ NJ renewable energy com
