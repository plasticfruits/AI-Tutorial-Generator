what's up everybody welcome back to my laboratory where safety is number one priority and today we're going to try to start the fire with the old nail and of course we'll need a hammer so let's see how it's done we will need another piece of metal that is really dense and piece of paper somewhere close by so what I'm going to do this hammers very old and it's not the best way to do the nail like this and smash it adhere very very hard protection as well okay let me try to do it with a small mouth okay I found better hammer because the other hammer was not good enough it's all the rows twisting on me it's very hot but not hot enough to start this paper on fire should heat it a little bit longer coconut husk never fails let's stir this again once you done this it best to just get a new nail because probably not going to work and don't forget about safety glasses definitely failed with this one okay took another break let's try this again with the smaller nails actually a little bit easier hopeful this time it will work they go it's starting to smoke but villas get it on fire real close look at fell off this thing I hear is so hot right now whoo but we fail again ok one more time but this time I'm going to be using newspaper [Applause] okay and now it's smoking a rabbit that's what do you want get some wind going shake it hopefully it will light up on fire I see more smoke there you go and we got it on fire it is a lot harder than it looks actually hey go well guys I was actually here for a couple hours partition and it's a lot harder than I thought honesty I wish I had better hammer this one is so old ec it's not even a squirrel certs Unbounce but that size of Mohammed would have been easier because with this hammer I was getting too tired and my accuracy wasn't as good so probably way better to do it with a little bigger than this hammer and make sure you don't have this old Unbounce unbalanced hammer so that way it does not go sideways all over I do not like this hammer anymore but yeah it's possible but it just takes a lot of practice also it's probably would be easier to do it with a piece of metal like this big so that way you can condense a lot more than a nail too because once you condensed this metal more and more and more and more and more and more that way it gets hotter hotter and hotter and hotter and I saw some videos people keep heating it to where it Jone super red right now it's too much Sun you won't even see that but if you in the dark you'll see once you start heating it for like two minutes constant heat like and you keep condensing it into layer square you're going to join the very very hard that is going to be a red hot and then you touch it to a paper you're going to light it up or some kind of kindling so that way you can start the fire with that anyway guys I thought it was a really cool trick I wanted to share it with you let me know in comments below what do you think don't forget to thumbs up this video subscribe and I'll see you next time oh yeah that's it oh there you go you see how hard it is maybe coconut husk you'll do better you see it smoking again not quite yet lighting up because we needed a little bit more persistent and get it hotter
