[Music] hello guys welcome back to the Ken survival Channel handy here today I use a Ferro rod and some natural materials that you can find in most woodland in the UK at least little bill went and I forgot my microphone so apologies for that so let's get started to begin I'm just going to show you what's called the file a basically I've got the area dug out a little my fire pit there was some nice flat pieces that I've them used an axe but you could batten down just a nice flat surface to work on I'm saying to give you a bed of embers when it burns down this is a brace at the back this is what you can all in pieces of wood against so you don't suffocate the fire we've got some small Kindle in here to begin the fire and then we got some slightly bigger followed by your main pieces and one reason I wanted to do this is because I've seen a few videos lately and people seem to struggle especially with a ferrocerium rod so yeah right so I've laid out here a few different ways of using natural Tinder's to light a fire first on the right over here we have feather sticks or wood shavings doesn't matter if the shaving stays on the wood or not doesn't matter at all it's just a showy thing as long as it gets the fire I mean just working so you just stand up your piece of wood and you just rub that blade down the edge creating shavings and get them as fine as you can it's going to take a bit of practice I'm not admitting I'm the best or anything but that's our first technique in the middle here we have some fat wood and I've created some shavings here done that by using the sharp spine of the knife if your knife doesn't have a sharp spine you can file it down and make it nice sharp right angle and that's just going to grind off some small sort of dust and then you can use the blade itself to create some finer shavings as well that's just going to help it start up properly you can find fat words like I have with this sort of lower limbs of pine trees only dead pine trees cut off the limb and you know you can tell when it's that weird it's quite if I pick some of this up here you can see when it's fat wood from the highly resinous material and you can see that's the normal width there has like an orange reddish hue to it and you can smell it as well on the end here we have one of the most abundant things in my area for sure and that's birch bark and you're going to find birch bark in a couple of different ways the older trees tend to have this kind of thicker bark only take it from the dead trees and some of the younger ones not sure if they are a different size or not have this very papery spark that they just shed and you can just pick it off as long as you're not taking too much as it's being shared anyway and both of these are highly resinous barks and I'll show you how to use both of them different types shortly have you are a kindling at hand and we'll get started so if you haven't seen one here's an example of a ferrous cerium rod or Ferro rod or fire steel whether you wish to call it this one has a an antler handle this one is made by diver outlaw bushcraft I'll put a link in the description if you want to buy one of these from him you brace in this in a couple of videos but any first cerium rods gonna work fine and you're gonna need every scraper which often come with the rods or a knife with a 90-degree spine even like a folding saw that's probably going to do it as well and as you can see on this one you can have a coating on the ferrocerium rod you need to scrape away exposes the rod I'm going to start off with the fat wood shavings here when making your tinder make twice as much as you think you'll need because you don't want to be starting all over again so always make as much as you can so I see lots of people just striking the rod from afar trying to get a fire so the distance between the rod and the material that sparks is going to be losing its heat it's not really a very way good way of doing it what I like to do is you've made yourself a stable surface it's put your rod right in the material and then with a lot of control of your blade you're going to come down into that material now what you can do first is go down the rod slowly and that's going to take off some of that material she's also going to help like that fire then you want going to come down on it nice hard and fast and controlled there you go don't be afraid to take more than one strike and you can get air into your tinder material there then you want to start adding on your kindling you'll see the black smoke coming off of this because of the high resin content as you can see it's going to help you get started next up here we have our feather sticks so you've got quite a lot of shavings there now I didn't have too much time but when you do fair use often come up with quite a flat surface here which is quite good for putting your ferrocerium rod on right up to the feathers it's pretty not going to work with this one right up to your feathers there you go and my other feathers falling apart a bit here as long as you've got a few of these you can be able to get your fire going and finally we're on our birch bark so like I said before there's kind of two different types you're gonna encounter really this is the harder older stuff I've kept this rolled up which pushes in the dog but if you hold this on the flat surface use your blade horizontally you should be able to make some scrapings okay so we've got a few shavings on this piece here gonna come down slowly the first cerium rod to give ourselves the best chance and then there we go this stuff does have a very high resin content I would recommend getting this if you can with any fire starting method and finally we've got this very thin paper II birch bark that you'll find I find the best thing to do with this is just tear it apart and give it a good rub and you'll see dust coming off of it it breaks it into tiny pieces make a pile I'll just get in there with your Ferro rod there you go now always lights very easily and there we have it just a few of the easiest ways of using a ferrocerium rod to light a fire with some natural Tinder's I hope that's helped you Jean get a gallon black not everyone does it the right way these are the ways that work from them so thanks very much I've been Andy of Ken survival if you've enjoyed the video check out some of my others I'll see you soon Oakley goodbye [Music]
