the bow drill technique is a primitive method for creating fire through friction the component should be collected from a soft wood source like cedar or Willow and they consist of a hearth board spindle bearing block bow and the tinder nest I'll be demonstrating how to forage and collect all natural materials for a bow drill friction fire set choose and gathered the most effective materials while you see them always have backup options they can be relied on as the materials needed to start the bow drill fire may not be in the same area where you stop your bow should be from your armpit to your fingertips in length it should have a slight curve to it and should be stiff and strong one end should have a Y while the other has a beaver chew indentation this will allow for easy cordage to be strung onto the bow both components the spindle and hearth board should be made from the same type of wood or from different woods of the same hardness your spindle should be anywhere from 8 to 12 inches in length with a slightly sharpened point on one end and a tapered thin point on the other where it'll go into your bearing block with your hearth board cut out it should be 8 to 13 inches in length about a half inch thick and one to two inches wide to accommodate for your spindle to sit firmly in the center this is known as the pilot hole this spot is actually where I burn in the diameter of the spindle into the hearth as he gives a place for it to sit with our fatwood bearing block now cut out the small indentation in the center once we begin to bow and create friction and heat the lubricant from the resin inside the bearing block will allow the spindle to glide friction free using whatever quarters you have we're going to string our bow together and using just a simple noose knot we're going to attach the cordage onto our top of our why and it will give us a place to bind now I'm going to bring the rest of our string down to where we've beaver chewed into our bow and I'm just going to begin to wrap the remaining cordage around where my hand will sit and then I'm going to just do in a basic overhand knot to tighten this up I'm just going to take my spindle and I'm going to see how it sits in the bow and all I'm going to do is place the spindle on the outside of the string and I'm gonna spin the top of the spindle around and in an upward motion with both ends in my hands pull up and that will lock the spindle in place I'm just using my hands right now and I'm toughing up the bark and releasing all the fibers inside of the grapevine bark and that will make it a lot easier once I put an ember into the tinder nest to blow to flame with the structure of our tenderness laid out all that's left to do is use our cedar bark that we shredded off of a tree and I'm going to tough those fibers up and I'm going to place that right in the center and I'm just going to use my finger I'm gonna make a hole down into the tinder nest where I'm going to drop my ember and then I can blow it to flame you're going to want to drill until you start to see charred dust and plumes of smoke from the hearth board the nut should resemble a V or a piece of pie as it is the carved out section of the hearth board that the dust accumulates and begins to form an ember in the knotch point should run just shy of the center of the burnin hole you want to apply a light amount of downward pressure to keep the spindle seated while constantly filling the knotch with dust and warming the hearth board once the notch is completely filled you can slowly add more speed and downward pressure creating more heat and igniting the dust into an ember tap the hearth board with your spindle to release the ember from the notch carefully placing the Ember into the center of the tinder nest and blowing it to flame while the bow drill is an incredibly advanced technique is also very rewarding just knowing that you have the ability to procure a fire source from the natural materials around you will definitely instill confidence [Music] you
