today I'm going to show you how to use coal to heat your house hey everybody welcome back to the homestead this is come in with living traditions homestead and the weather outside is terrible it is cold as well see you down into the single digits tonight we could even get below zero with the windchill which for Missouri is pretty cold and it's supposed to stay that way for several days so I thought that this would be the perfect opportunity to show you guys how to make a fire in your stove with coal and how to keep that going on these really cold days most of the time we burn wood in our stove mostly because it's free we can harvest it ourselves and it does a really good job but during really long stretches of cold weather we actually like to burn coal sometimes now I'll tell you this stove is designed to burn both wood and coal not all stoves are so if you have a stove make sure that your stove is capable and designed to burn coal otherwise you could wreck your stove our stove is a D stove it is the comfort max 75 and for our house which is about 1400 square feet it does a really really good job to heat our entire house the type of coal that we're going to be using is anthracite coal this is not to be confused with charcoal that you would use for your grill charcoal is a man-made material used by burning wood without oxygen to create charcoal this is anthracite coal which is a natural mineral a fossil fuels you know millions of years old and needs to be you know mined in order to get it out of the ground one of the reasons that we really like to burn coal during these cold stretches is that once you get it going it burns for very long time at a very consistent temperature and you really don't have to do much with it unlike wood that burns you know fairly fast like on this once we get a good fire going you know we add what about every four or five hours we'll add a few more logs but with coal once you get it going it's really like every 12 hours maybe even a little longer and you don't have to do anything with it in between there so it works really really well when you have a good long cold stretch or when you want to really keep the fire going really warm all night long so it's a pretty easy process of course you need coal we buy it in bags that's the only way that I know of at least here in the United States that you can get it at least in this part of the country so we buy it in these bags we were actually given a thousand pounds of coal free when we bought our stove and we're still working on that so we don't use it real often but we do really like it when we use it so the first thing I'm going to do is get a good wood fire going in the stove now in our stove the bottom is like a metal grate now normally when you're burning just wood there's a plate that goes in there they kind of restrict some of the air flow and it just makes it burn more consistently for wood when you're doing a coal fire you want to make sure you take that plate out so it's more of a you know open grate in the bottom and you get better airflow from the bottom up so I've already done that I've taken that plate out and I'm going to get a good wood fire started in the stove I still have some coals left from last night's fire that I'm going to use to get this going and the way that I like to get a fire going is what's called a top-down fire our stove is what they consider an east-west stove which means the logs run this way and there's also north so stoves which are longer front to back and you would put your logs in this way so on our stove they go in east and west so I'll put two or three big logs you know in the bottom of the stove put my old coals on top and then a little bit of kindling to get a fire going on top of those logs and that will burn down it'll make a nice better wood coals on the bottom of the stove once I get that going I'll show it to you and I'll show you the next step after that which will be starting to add the coal to the fire okay so you can see I have my logs in I have my fire started on top of the logs and we're gonna let this burn now for probably a good hour hour and a half before we start adding any coal we want this wood to burn down into a nice bed of coals before we start adding our actual coal so you want to make sure you have all of your baffles open so you have good airflow and again we're just gonna let this burn down for you know anywhere from an hour to two hours depending on how quickly the wood is a that you have so I'm gonna shut the door and we're gonna let this get started as a fire and I'll come back and show you the next step when we get ready to add some coal okay so my wood fire is going really well there's already a pretty good bed of coals down the bottom I can see on my temperature gauge that it's already into the green which means it's you know had a good temperature so what I'm gonna do now is just kind of smooth out the coals from the wood and then we're going to start putting the actual call on top so this is this is what the coal looks like again this is anthracite coal it's a hard call it burns very very clean and but it does take a little you know it's not super easy to get licked but once it's lit it does a really good job so what I'm going to do again is smooth out the coals on top and then we're going to shovel on probably three or four decent-sized these little shovel loads of the coal under the top of those let those start to catch and we'll add more call about every 20 to 30 minutes until we have a good bed of coal in the stove okay so you can see there's a good bed of coals here on top and my lot my bigger logs are really starting to be catch so that's good now again I'm just going to smooth those out on top and then I'm going to take several of these [Music] that's about good I don't want to put so much it then it gets smothered out so I'm going to put that in for now that's three shoulder load and we're just going to shout it up and we're gonna let that start to catch now you'll notice when it starts to catch you'll start to see like a real blue kind of flame and that's exactly what you want once we see that going good we'll add more and then we'll just keep adding more and more until the entire wood stove is filled up on the bottom with a good bed of probably I don't know five to six inches of coal on the bottom and that will keep us going for a good 12 hours it'll probably take in total about 240 pound bags to get that initial bed of coals going on the bottom okay so it's been about 30 minutes and the initial coal that I put in has caught and it's it's burning pretty good so I'm going to put more coal in now I'm going to spread out what's in there I'm gonna put more coal on top this time I'm going to put quite a bit more in I'm going to cover up you know quite a bit of the bottom with with a good layer of coal and we're gonna get that going and then again in about 30 minutes if that is caught we will do this all over again so this time I'm gonna try shaking a little bit in here and put a pretty good layer down in the bottom now you can see the fire kind of coming up through the coal that's exactly what you want we're just going to shut this and again we'll leave it Karl about a half hour and then we'll add more coal again and this next time we'll even be able to add more okay so it's been about another 30 minutes or so and you can see that the bed of coals is really going well now so now I'm going to add the rest of this bucket of coal to the top and that will give us a nice bed of coals and I'm just going to keep doing this every time I see that it's going really well I'm going to add more until we have this completely filled to the top of the firebox and now one thing that I did mention is that when you do this what you want to do is just one corner I don't think it really matters what corner but one corner you want to always leave that open like not not put nuke all in one corner and that will allow the heat from the other coal to kind of spread better I'm not remember I don't remember where I learned that but it was on a video that I watched and that's what they said to do and I can tell you it works really well it helps the new call family catch quicker so that's what I'm going to do I'm going to put this in and I'll leave the back corner kind of open and then we'll come back in about another 30 minutes okay so you can see I have the nuke bed of coals on top that'll get started and you see I've just left that back corner open that again will allow the new coal to light a little easier will also allow some of the gases that off of the new call to have a place to kind of burn off and I just burn more efficiently all right it's been about four hours since the time that we started getting our fire going and now we have a beautiful coal fire I Sarah's gonna zoom in here so you guys can see just how beautiful those coals are but now that this is going again I won't have to do anything with this until tomorrow morning about every 12 hours you just take your handle over here on the side and you just shake the coal a little bit so you let some of the fine particles drop through and then I'll just add a little more coal on top and really it's it's as easy as that once you get a coal fire going you really don't have to mess with it at all I just went look at the thermostat in the house and it's currently 75 degrees in our house which honestly is a little on the warm side but overnight like I said it's supposed to get down below zero and this will keep the house beautiful all night long so you guys I hope that this was helpful to you if you're debating about you know what type of stove to get for your homestead you know I would highly consider getting one that can burn both the wood and coal again ours is a d/s stove it's called the Comfort max 75 and we've been very very happy with it you guys if you're not a
