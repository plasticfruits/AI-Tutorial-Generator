guess what it's spring in Utah [Music] nothing provides like safety and shelter and comfort like a good fire unfortunately when you need it it's usually like the hardest time to make it so we're going to show you today how to use the stuff in the 72 how to find a really good spot to do this and how to set up a fire really quick even in a place like Utah where could snow at any minute like today there come okay guys so this is a really great example of a good place to hide out you've got some nice shelter from the wind you've got some overhanging branches this is gonna help us get a fire going and not have to compete with the wind and the snow hitting you sideways and fighting you the whole way so one of the tricks when it's this wide you have a heavy snowstorm where rain is actually finding dry material it's gonna burn like good tinder you can see there's some some brush that we can find that probably's gonna work well but if that's even too wet there's a reason we put this palm on top of this beanie so if it's snowing like this one of the cool things is this is kind of providing some shelter or some really nice dry leaves right underneath here I think this is gonna work pretty well so I'm gonna source some of these I think this is gonna burn really well but if not I want to show you something else follow me so sometimes you can just let wildlife do the work for you I mean I hate to steal somebody's home but this is a perfect pile of dry small material it's gonna light right out I pulled this out of the nest because they've pulled it off trees a long time ago it's not green anymore it's super dry snaps really easy this is gonna be great stuff to help start that fire so I've got a nice flat space here it's got clear sky above it we're not gonna start the trees on fire and I'm gonna start using the tools of 72 to clear space off collect some dry kindling and get this thing going so let's get after we're similar to do is grab this shovel in here so this is the tools pocket we've got a paracord shovel axe which I'm gonna use right now duct tape knife fire Schneider and then an extra water bladder in case you're storing a bunch of liquids so I like to just pull the things out I need cover this back up you know the 72 is waterproof so sitting in here keeps it dry in the bottom and this is gonna keep it on top so the first thing I'm gonna do is get a little shovel here this nice little kit thanks pretty useful packs down really small opens up really easy you just tighten this collar and then suddenly you're good to go so I'm gonna clean off a pretty a pretty big dry spacer for the fire she's gonna help us start it later so there's three pieces to a really good fire there's there's tinder which is the dry leaves kindling which are very small small pieces of wood and then just just the wood itself now don't go pulling green branches off of trees those are gonna be really difficult to light there's so much moisture and instead I like to find stuff on the ground that's old and white and you can snap really easy it's a really good sign that it's dry it's looks like a pretty good piece here see how it just breaks it's not green this is good stuff so you want to break off a bunch of pieces here we'll take this back to our fire there's a ton of ways you can start fire in your 72 but my favorite obviously is these matches these things are great they're wind proof weather proof water proof you could start a fire under water in these things I'm not kidding so this is my go to right now to get this thing started here here's the matches you're gonna notice they look different than normal matches all this is gonna burn giving you a bigger brighter flame that's gonna last a lot longer [Applause] last thing a fire needs is oxygen just light blowing on this is gonna bring fresh oxygen in move the carbon dioxide out of the way and you've got yourself a fire so we were lucky today we found some really good dry stuff but let's say everything's just soaked and you have no other option there is one more thing we can do here take this baby off we're gonna cut this off and use this as your kindling get this fire started check it out sometimes you cut them sometimes you just pull right off we actually blew these on very loosely for this purpose I'm gonna put my hat back on it's important to stay warm right so let's get this big on here I'm gonna put this down under here give it a nice little home make sure it's protected grab my matches where we go [Applause] that was easy guys anybody can do that anywhere doesn't matter if you in a snowstorm like this or the middle of a desert that's great kindling to get the fire started you want to make sure to get the other stuff started right away because that's eventually gonna burn out you also make sure your dog doesn't eat the fire very important as you can see it's pretty easy to start a fire in virtually any environment with just what's inside 270 to stay safe out there guys and remember don't die
