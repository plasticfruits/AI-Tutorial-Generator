hey guys it's a mom and Kristina from Aris journey today we're gonna talk about early retirement in particular we're gonna talk about staying early retired the average person plans on retiring at 62 which gives them about 20 years to live in retirement but now with a fire movement if you're talking about retiring at 30 or 40 that gives you up to 50 or even more years to live in retirement so there's a big difference of retiring at 62 in terms of how much you have to live off of versus if you retire at 30 or 40 but with proper planning you can actually retire at 30 or 40 and still remain in retirement for the rest of your life so let's talk about the actions that you can take now in order to be successful in retirement for the rest of your life so the first thing an early retiree wants to do is determine their expenses for the next 60 years yeah and I think that's really strange for people to think about it first because you think how am I supposed to figure out what my expenses are gonna be 60 years from now the same way that you would determine your expenses for the next 60 years would be the same way a 62 year old retiree determines their expenses you make an educated guess everyone's situation is different and of course you have some common costs that you have to pay like housing transportation medical bills things like that but you hope you also have to think of other expenses that might be unique to you the next thing that you should keep in mind when you're planning on early retirement is creating a phased drawdown plan a phase drawdown plan is how you're going to collect the income to support yourself in retirement and it exists in stages so you'll get different forms of income at different periods of time suppose you retire at 40 with $1,000,000 that you save from age 20 to 40 you're $1,000,000 we'll give you an average income of $40,000 per year $1,000,000 may seem like a lot of money but if you watch some of our other videos we show you how you can save a million dollars less than 10 years in this particular example you have 20 years to save a million dollars so your drawdown plan is this what is this first phase the $40,000 that you're living off of but if you fast forward you move to the next phases at age 57 some of you may be entitled to a deferred pension what's great is that two and a half years later at age 59 and a half you can then begin collecting your 401k so now you're 62 and what happens at 62 that's the first phase that you can start collecting Social Security keep in mind if you start collecting your Social Security early at age 62 you're going to be collecting less but it's still an option so let's summarize all of these different phases we're talking about your initial $1,000,000 that you saved and then later at 57 you have your deferred pension and then at 59 you have your 401 K that you can draw from and then at 62 you have your Social Security see this is what's so amazing about early retirement is that if you plan it correctly you will phase into old age with a ton of money the next thing you want to do is think about diversifying your sources of income so a lot of retirees have their money in the stock market but you also want to think of other forms of income including passive income that can help you throughout retirement and what's great is if you are pre-planning and you're thinking ahead before retirement of course you can really form a great nest egg of passive income prior to your actual retirement yeah so we're doing this actually right now we're coming up with different forms of passive income so that when we retire we can pull on those before we actually have to pull on our assets in the stock market and you know as an early retiree you may also want to take on a seasonal job but whatever you do in retirement it's really just gravy on the cake is it cake no I mean it's turkey turkey out of it right but whatever you do it's things to supplement your you the retirement income that you already have coming in from your stocks so this brings us to our fourth tip and it is planned for the worst case scenario now this is probably what keeps a lot of people from retiring early when in fact they can I mean we know people that are actually very high up in age they have a ton of money but they fear going into retirement because of these worst-case scenarios let's talk about some of the worst-case scenarios worst case scenario could be your home is completely damaged due to fire or floods you have a medical emergency that could potentially wipe out your savings I mean all of these things if you don't have the proper planning or insurance in place could devastate your retirement so worst-case scenario planning would be getting insurance depending on your situation try to get the insurance that that's the most appropriate don't cut costs in this particular area we've talked about worst case scenario in terms of insurance but let's talk about our next action plan which is worst case scenario in terms of having to go back to work yeah so let's say your first couple of years of really retirement you lose all your money somehow some way or you retire and you're bored right the worst thing that can happen is that you go back to your normal life you go back to work so you always want to kind of keep this as plan B now we do have to acknowledge that the longer you're out of the workforce the more difficult it is to get back in but if you're focused on different passive forms of income and things that you enjoy then you don't necessarily have to go back to the same profession that you were in before for example if you have different passions that you've pursued during retirement like photography writing doing videos or anything that you're really interested in in order to get more money you don't have to go back to that old profession that you are in you can focus on your passions and create a business friend that yeah I mean early retirement doesn't mean that you just go home and sit on the couch and do nothing you most people do what they're passionate about and let's say that passion produces income for you that's the power of being able to retire early that's the power of financial independence but I want to talk about this going back to work thing because there are people I mean I've worked with people that have left the workforce and what they've left on really good terms so if you if you do retire early don't walk out of your office in a like blaze glory in a blaze of glory that's because you can always go back I mean you could always use those folks as references the thing is don't burn those bridges now we've just talked about five different things five different action plans that you should be thinking about for early retirement and how to successfully remain retired retiring early is a very big decision and we just want to stress that you should really think about the points that we made but also points there particular to you you know we didn't talk about retiring abroad we didn't talk about retirement with children we didn't talk about retiring a single everyone's situation is different but take those into account when you develop your your early retirement plan we hope you found this video informative and if you like this video please give us a thumbs up
