what's up guys for today's video we're going to die to start the fire with the hand convey to you one of this vintage items distance are amazing they are so old but still working properly and working smoothly as you can see you can go as fast as you can and it's gonna spin a little bit fast so I thought why not try to put a stick over here and die to start the fire with it because you don't need any electricity if you have one of this somewhere all good or in the forest maybe you work in somewhere and you forgot matches and you want to start the fire you can still do so with this letter let's see if it works or not I actually had to sharpen it up a little bit so it would fit in here now got twisted so it would hold together bingo I don't think it going anywhere now then I'm gonna just set it up like this and then spin it I think the whole idea is just to keep it steady ah fail the book off okay let's try to stick it in and now make it tight so what I'm gonna do is cut out this matches and then make little dents I use these ones before then I'm going to put my coconut husk down here and my deal gonna go right inside there and then we're gonna spin it like this I don't want to put too much pressure so that's what speaks really it's not about the pressure it's about friction oh no look how much smoke we were getting it almost there but I'll stick broke off you see insider it's broke off so what I'm gonna do is just take off this book and peace from there and once again I'll get my stick and make it a little smaller so that way it fits to do just like this not too small but the good size perfect fit that's what I'm looking for okay now we go tied up set the whole bit again not too tight and as you can see that my ankle here I'm hoping they do all evenly together and put in push on here and spinning it like this because they see if it goes back and forth we're just going to lose the stick I think it's already porky up they go poke it again okay let's try this one more time am i a physician myself for a bit going to hold it like this so that way keep in its case is it smoking yeah looking a little bit okay I think I found a good way to do it you said it like this hold it on your shoulders here and then fold that state DVDs um and go crazy of added OSA I have shortened this handle it used to be way out here I have shortened it like this so that way I can go even faster look at the friction look at that smoke oh yeah look at how much is smoking now I can go back and fold the other way let's see yeah it's smoking he'll be good that's stuff into here and you see that's what we want we wanted to smoke like this and close it together and blot it you can even wave it like this oh don't wanna lose a dog waving it it's even better because you get more oxygen oh yeah look how smoked it is now and they go we got that coconut husk on fire also it's not about too much pressure either you wanna have medium speed medium pressure and you just have to keep practicing and you'll figure it out [Music] please not too much pressure you wanna get it early with smokey if you pass it too hard you're not gonna have enough friction if you put medium pressure on it it can spin early easily and you're going to have a lot of friction and they said here you see we wanted to start smoking like that that's what we're looking for once it starts smoking like that putting them on to the coconut husk of something flammable and that way you can get your fire started very easily let me show you what happens when you blow it you see how hot it gets deadly a piece what makes fire started I noticed honestly the best way to do it just hold it like this with your knee put it together so that way it's more comfortable it's important to have it tight make them go a little bit faster you can also go like that to whatever is comfortable you want to go a little fast like this not too much not too much pressure it's not about process it's about the speed this one if you see smoke that's enough pressure medium pressure that's what you want smoking smoking good good get that coconut husk let me get closer to you smoking the bug stuff don't close it together without smothering it start slowly blowing to get more smoke again I like the idea of waving it slowly maybe in circles to get some oxygen going but make sure you hold it tight enough so you don't lose it as you can see it just gotta be patient just keep waving it it's smoking pretty good right now that's what we wanna see and that can start shaking it more smoking even more now we can go like crazy and boom we got it on fire they go really cool will to start the fire with the conch do you by the way coconut husk definitely an awesome way to start the fire with I always order some to put it into my fire kit because it's gone so well and easy to light it up alright guys that's pretty much it let me know in comments below about this idea ten clunk drill this one is really really old at least like 60 70 years old these things are awesome because they don't go bad you don't need any electricity so if you work in off-grid somewhere in the forest building something you can also use it to start the fire bit pretty amazing huh and of course don't forget to thumbs up this video subscribe and I'll see you next time
