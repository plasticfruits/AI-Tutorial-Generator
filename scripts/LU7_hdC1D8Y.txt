shannon davis and one thing we're going to talk about today is like one of the key skills of anyone who's going outside having a fire makes it like home adds ambiance and it also saved your life by keeping you warm all night and so we're going to talk about how to put so much good energy into building a fire you can build it with one match you can light it with one match and so what we've got or materials that we've gathered just in the past ten minutes or so we're going from tinder to kindling kindling being like about pencil size or smaller and going up to fuel which would be about thumb size or bigger and then some of the bigger things that would hopefully last you the night through being like maybe wrist size or larger it's the first thing we're going to do is contain our fire so that we don't burn the forest down and make the news clear out the area we're going to build your fire the little ring and this won't stop stray sparks that may come from your fire but it'll help just just keep it contained and away from little bits like this it it could catch before we build our fire when talk a second about fire starters my personal favorite big lighter but there's lots of ways you can start a fire we also have matches here in a pill bottle to keep them dry but there's a film canister to you there's lots of commercial fire starters out there on the market one of which is sort of like sawdust or wood shavings and wax that kind of burn like a candle and another you can make easily at home is a cotton ball with vaseline on those actually burn really well the first thing I'm going to do is grab three pieces of my thumb sides fuel just three look good and so what I'm going to do with those is build a little triangle in the middle of my fire ring as it gives me a platform to put my tinder right on top of it and I like to do that because when I would put my match underneath it's lighting the tinder directly from a from below instead of from the side like if you had just piled your tinder on the ground next thing we're going to do is get our tinder broken down into a bundle of tinder bundle which looks you know a lot like let's say a bird nest and just can take a little bit of time but the more energy you put into building a good fire more likely just alight with just one match so I've got the tinder - nice little master tinder bundle I'm going to start putting it right on top and moving on to our kindling so some of these little tiny twigs are like say pencil size are smaller I'm going to start the smaller stuff and just break it up and kind of keep piling it on top now we're moving on to some of the some of our larger kindling pencil size our bigger I'm going to add those to the pile when we're all all said and done and just about ready to light this guy we should have a pile of material that's maybe four or six inches high in that area next step we're going to fire it up you got good flames going I'm going to do is just get a look at it from the side I'm going to move a rock away so I can get a good look at it it looks like we're going to do fine but I'm going to blow on it just a little bit just to make sure if you follow these simple steps you'll have a fire pretty much any can
