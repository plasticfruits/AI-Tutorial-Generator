the basic premise of a fire is something that is smaller like a match it's going to burn faster than something's big so first thing is leis and kindling out kind of a smaller the better again I'm just kind of pile it up in a little pile so I'm not trying to get the whole thing done at one time just try to get a 1 in spot filling the key components where you need the fuel which is going to be wood and then it needs air so kind of structure in such a way that's got as much air as possible so I'm just kind of pouring it on here so they'll kind of be a little more bizarre shape and they'll stack up a little bit better so this is a classic kind of teepee structure here right it'll take some pieces are slightly bigger put those on and then last but not least I'm going to put on my logs of course I've set them here so if they roll they're not going to roll out the fire touch the house on fire this is your basic structure again air wood and set up in such a way that it's not going to roll out onto your lid or carpet very hands down alright second thing and this is really key tip is tearing the newspaper so you can use a newspaper use any kind of paper magazine like a coated any Coda's not get burned I wear so I grab it here I just tread these little strips and again if you shuffle it up it's not going to work at all this is like maximum fuels maximum air there's just a little bit of paper plump it up sit under light it with a match
