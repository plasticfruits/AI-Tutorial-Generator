how to start a fire learn how to do this you'll stay warm you'll stay alive but more importantly you'll keep your family happy when they crawl out of that tent now everybody has sort of a different approach to starting a fire tepee fire a cabin fire over the years I've come up to where I like to build a platform before I even start laying down my fire building materials which we'll talk about in a second but what I've done is I've laid three sticks down parallel keeping plenty of space between them so we get some airflow a couple of others on top of those that's going to hold all my fire building materials off the ground a little bit which I think helps especially if the ground is wet but it also leaves an airspace up under my fire building materials and as the heat begins to rise the convection will bring in fresh air under my fire building materials and help this fire catch a lot more quickly so with my platform in place I can begin working the fire with my three different kinds of fire-making materials the first is called tinder here it is it's very fine very dry materials that are going to catch a flame quickly this is sort of the first step towards the fire I've got some little pieces of pine in here some pine needles I found some ropey bark that I shredded that this will burn very very quickly that's the tinder the second is kindling and that's larger pieces of material sticks some other pine pieces in here they're going to burn from the flame that the tinder puts up some larger pieces of kindling it up to your finger all the way up to maybe wrist size that's the kindling and then the last is the fuel and those are the bigger logs that you're going to put on here for a long slow burn and to make coals so let's start off we've got our platform here I'm just going to take my tinder bundle get all this material here and set it on my platform and you can see how it's off of the ground that grounds wet at all my materials stay dry then I'm going to build in with some of my your piece is sort of a teepee style right around here making sure that I've got pieces that are small enough to catch those initial flames so I've got my thinner bundle in place I've got a little bit of my kindling my small killing on there we've got a striking of our match let's get this fire going nice now once those flames start building just a little bit if I wanted to come in here and start a little bit of a log cabin little cross fire this would be a good time to do it build it and they will come hey guys it's practically lunchtime could you get out of the tent
