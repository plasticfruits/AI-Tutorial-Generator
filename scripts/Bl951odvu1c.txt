okay so welcome to the episode we're gonna do on fire making in the desert [Music] really though the principles of fire making are the same wherever you are the key is remember preparation preparation preparation [Music] there is nothing worse than putting all the effort into maybe whether it's with a friction fire or bone drill or whatever it is you know to get a little uh heat and an ember and a spark or whatever it is and then you haven't got the rest of the fire ready to go so preparation is key uh if you're in wet climates get cover get out of the wind starting fire in adverse conditions is just about practice but before we do anything the most important thing to remember with fire it's a fire triangle the three elements that all fires need first of all is heat you got to have a heat source and you can generate heat in many ways and generate it from the heat of the sun you can generate it through friction uh you know you got to have that heat second you need you need oxygen you've got to have oxygen to allow that flame to ignite and thirdly you need fuel okay something that's actually then going to burn if you starve a fire of any of these three elements it's going to go out so if you've only got oxygen and fuel you know we've got oxygen and fuel here there's no fire you know you've got to have all three heat oxygen and fuel so remember that when you're preparing your fire first of all you need good tinder tinder is anything that's going to take that initial spark or that initial focal point of heat or that initial ember it's the first point of contact for fuel for heat that you're going to start your fire with you want this to be as thin and as dry and as fibrous as possible dry bird nests are great you want to then really ruffle them up so you get all those tiny little fibers that are going to take that initial spark without good tinder you're never going to start a fire if you try and start a fire straight onto bigger fuel like this it's just not gonna burn you know you have to build your way up when you're in a desert environment like this uh that's easy because everything is dried and parched but if you're in a jungle or you're in wet or mountainous climates you've got to be smarter you've got to maybe peel the bark off dead wood to get to the drier wood inside don't be going for any green wood green wood has a lot of moisture in it it's not going to burn okay so this is the first thing you need good tinder then you need good kindling and again smaller like i was saying the size of your little finger is a good indicator this sort of stuff and again a good way to judge whether kindling is good to burn is to break it and if it sounds like the crackle of a fire like that you know it's going to be good for your fire if it's just green and it kind of goes like that it's not going to be good so you want this crackle and that's going to be good kindling so that's your second thing good kindling and then the final thing once you've got your kindling going you need a bigger fuel anything bigger logs you know one of these would be great uh here ultimately if i was spending the night here you know i know i'd build a fire under here and i've got a good fuel source i'd actually probably start the fire right down the end where it touches the ground and eventually you're gonna get this smoldering even if you fall asleep you know you're going to still have an ember there that you can restart your fire from if you need to now we're ready to go but how do you actually start that initial fire and that is the part that is always tricky people spend days and days and days as a group trying to start fires you know it's hard if you don't do it and you've never been taught it it's hard but there are many different ways of doing it i'm not going to go into detail on this lesson all the different types of friction fire we're going to do that in other episodes when we're in the jungle and stuff but for now we're going to just show you a couple of simple ways first of all imagine one of your team has got some glasses you can use the broken glass or the actual glass lens themselves to focal the uh to focal the sun into a narrow point and generate heat dark glasses aren't going to work but if we use one of the glasses here one from the crew okay so look glasses like this and you can see look at my hand there see that hot spot and all that is is the sun so we can use the lens from the glasses and it focuses and concentrates that beam of light onto a little spot on my hand i can even even though it's only 10 in the morning here i can feel the heat you know certainly by midday out here that sun is going to be powerful enough if i hold it and i'm patient enough that will start a fire on this dried grass but like i say you don't do all this effort and get a flame and then you haven't got your kindling or your other fuel ready that's why you got to be prepared preparation so key so that would generate enough heat to start fire you can even you reflect the inside of coke cans polish it up and that will reflect like a mirror and generate heat they even people who made fire out of ice so they've taken the ice and then made it into the shape of like a lens and they've used that to concentrate the sun bamboo is a great resource to start fire because you create so much friction fast with it i would say one of the key skills of fire lighting beyond persistence is actually ingenuity but what i'm going to show you today is the way you actually do it with a fire steel if i had to take one piece of survival equipment with me into the wild i'd probably first of all pick a good blade actually a good knife maybe a small machete but beyond that i would say a fire steal because with fire you can do so much it's not only going to keep you warm at night it allows you if you're wet to dry out clothes it allows you to cook food it allows you to boil water boiling water in the wild is critical you can't just be drinking water where you find different streams or stagnant pools you're more than likely going to get six you've got to boil the water for that you need fire fire you can make tools you can deter predators so the ability to make fire and carry a fire steel like this is i would say a key weapon in a survivor's arsenal the reason i like fire strikers like this is that they work even when they're wet you know you take some matches into the wild and you get wet it starts raining you have to river crossing crossings the end of the matches same with lighters but the fire steel like this is gonna work even when it's wet and all this does is make that nice and simple for you creates that spark but it's a spark that we're gonna put into this dry tinder the tinder's going to ignite and then we've got to be fast and we've got to be ready with the kindling the final thing i'll say before we actually like this is build your fire off the ground many times i've tried to start fires in swampy areas and if it's just wet underneath it's going to put the fire out so build it up a little bit and and then you're good to go of course the final final thing is be very careful with forest fires yeah don't mess around with those so always protect the area you're gonna do it with ideally if you've got rocks you could put rocks around and make a fire pit that protects the fire we're gonna light this and we're gonna put it out pretty fast because we're in a super dry area here but what i want to do today is just show you the simple principle of fire making and how to use that fire striker with this the key is hold one hand steady you know people go like this and they end up getting the spark and they put it out with their hands hold one hand steady and the other hand pulls and creates a spark [Music] and there we go we have fire and then i'll be putting the kindling on top of it and building it up people ask often about the best uh shape to build a fire you know people do crisscross ones and square fires they've actually proven the most efficient shape for building a fire is that tp1 you know so it looks kind of like this it's as wide at the bottom as it is high and it's like a triangle and that allows the heat to rise and the oxygen to flow through it final tip never smother the fire once you got it going i always think it's like children if you put too much on this you smother children it kills their spirit same with a fire don't smother it give it room and time to breathe with oxygen and then the fire will look after you late into your night and just like is late into your life so there you go i hope this helped little master class on a fire preparation and had to light a fire uh with a fire striker [Music] [Music] [Music] you
