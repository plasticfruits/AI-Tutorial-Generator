I wanna talk to you a little bit about friction fire the tools that you need are you need your hearth board you need a spindle and you also need a nest with a nest I like to start out with the my longer fibers I'll just twist those around to form a little bit of a pocket with the tinder nest you want everything pretty tight so at the spindle and hearth you want something fairly light but most important it's the grain structure if you look at this one you would see little grains almost little holes and pores in here so you want to make a starter hole so I make a divot in there you can sit on here your butt like this or another technique that helps is you get get up on above it either on both knees or one knee you can sometimes put a little bit more weight on it this way what the starter hole just want to get to that point or just start smoking so the knotch basically I start by cutting at the top because I can see it and it's basically like cutting on a piece of pie what it's doing is allowing the pump to accumulate one spot once you have that prepared you want something to catch the coal like this wood chip or a leaf or something set it down nice and secure we want you ready and we make sure your hands have enough friction on the spindle you can either spit on it or if you run out of spit you can have a little bit of water nearby rub that in your hands the key is you're putting a lot more pressure on it than yours so I'm actually pushing really hard inward and downward at the same time and that that driving force what's gonna beats the coal so as you're going once you see that basically you have smoke coming out of out of the pile of punk at that point you can stop tap any leftover Punk on it I'll keep going you can see it's it's red-hot and then it dropped the coal in the nest seems counterintuitive but you want to squeeze that nest and really cradle that coal way down in there deep breath you want to increase the breath hardness as it starts spreading that's it you want to turn it on its side towards the wind hey you got a fire and that's it that's that's friction fire in a nutshell right there
