hey guys thanks for joining me in another video I'm gonna do a quick one today I know it's been a while since I post things I sincerely apologize for that it's been a crazy summer anyway I wanted to show you four ways to make fire with a Ferro rod that's very very easy it doesn't take a lot at all the four different ways anyone can do one of them might I tell them actually might be a little bit harder than the other two but let's get started and I'll show you what I mean [Music] [Music] all right first thing we're doing to my backyard so we need just something that to contain the fire may use this cookie sheet here I haven't used it forever the first method I want to show you now the key to all this is having a sharp striker so here's my Ferro rod my striker this one's particularly this particular one is titanium so it can grab and and strike very easily so that's number one number two a knife this is the more robust of my favorite knives I've ground the spine a bit so it's nice and nice purchase on it so again I can use that to strike the fair out if I want first mest i want to show you is this right here this is just piece of pine wood this particular one is called fat wood because it's impregnated with SAP but if you want to you can but you need to do is just take little bits of these there's this stuff off of here just small flakes and throw it in the pine and the tin but what you want to do is create just shavings and you don't have to be very good at this I'm terrible at it so I just create some shavings here there's the guys that are watching that are cringing right now because they're far better at this than I am all I want to do create a small pile shavings like so and then throw a spark into it because of how flammable this stuff is now you usually generally want to make it bigger than this but if it lights up very easily because of how flammable this stuff is so that is method number one again this is stuff is called fat wood it's the SAP and pregnant part of a pine and it like I say it'll burn long enough that you can get your the smaller kindling put it right on top and you're good to go that way throw that off because we don't need any more the second method I want to show you jute twine and I got this stuff at the dollar store I got two rolls for a buck just find the end of it pull off a chunk along I'm gonna pull off a decent-sized bit of this stuff here cut it off and now you can take this and unravel it I don't use this myth a lot because I just forget to bring it so I'm gonna take this I'm gonna unravel it I want to just kind of frayed up a bit like that just so it's got a lot of fibers hanging off you know you can you can spend your time and unravel it if you want but phone alarms going off pause the video edit time we're getting there so I want to take this know when I just fray it so it looks like a snarled Messier sister's hair put that in a pile like that you have your spark row this you can stick it right down there and there it goes well there it went provided you Freitas well enough it will begin to burn and it'll burn long enough and hot enough to catch catch other things on fire so jute twine very cheap stuff you can get at the dollar store like I said it's often above your ass over there alright so cheap twine kind sat down to this one yukine to make these or buy these and all this is is a piece of wax would essentially all is really just wax it's just shavings of some kind and say it's just kind of some shavings with that that has had wax put into it you can use anything flammable mix it with any kind of wax and you can make this stuff so this is a little more technical you've got to make some curls of this get some curls going yeah I used to use this a lot not so much anymore because it's time-consuming to make this stuff nice to take these things then I can press them together a little bit striker I can't even see this stuff what am I doing here what am I doing here take your striker press it up in there throw some strikes at it until it ignites there goes very very simple very simple now the last but not least everybody's got this stuff everybody's got this stuff right dry Erland this is one that I use a lot because when your hands are cold in here thumbs don't want to work this works great so wrap you don't need to do anything with it just grab it throw it down and hit it with a spark and it goes like it is it's one of the most simple ways to start a fire there is there you go for very simple ways to start a fire thanks for watching I love your faces we'll make a longer one soon and hit the like button subscribe and all that I'll talk to you later
