well I'm a specific love whether you like camping or hiking or some point you're going to want to make a fire so here are 10 great fire starters that you can make with household items let's begin first up you're going to need some duct tape now you need the good quality stuff don't get the cheap dollar brand doesn't seem to work as well but get some duct tape then you're going to need a cotton ball now I'm taking some of the duct tape and I wrapped it around the cotton ball and this just helps keep similar water and whatever dirt I might get on it off of it now you can take this thing and rip it open if you can now you can see all the fibers from the cotton ball showing and you can take it lighter and if you light off the cotton it will then burn enough to catch the duct tape on fire there you go [Music] for the next one we're going to use crayons and some large cotton balls so you're taking some of the crayons we broke them up and we're going to melt these down now that we have the crayons melted I just happen to have a toothpick we're going to dip these cotton balls in hopefully it will stay on the toothpick there is a very colorful firestarter try this again with a second one actually we'll just use my hands this time see if I keep from getting burned that is very cool all right let's see how well these burn there we go right quick to burn and they seem very quick to light and they seem to be burning very well it's a cool little colorful firestarter [Music] for this next when I've been collecting some sawdust from some other builds put it in bag when used sawdust and use a nice a curtain now this has to be the cardboard type version don't use the plastic and of course some candles all right now we have one of the Excel egg curtains a little holder there we're going to put a little bit of sawdust in it okay now we're going to carefully add some of this wax from this candle [Music] now we're to give this a little bit of time to fully cure and then we'll light this on fire [Music] next up we're going to be using a dryer lid and a chola paper roll we've found the dryer lint up into somewhat of a nice round shape here and we have stuffed it inside the toilet paper roll that's just to give it some structure now we're also going to be using some of the candle wax for that right nicely inside there you can see it is quickly absorbing that wax into that dryer lint [Music] we're going to give that a second to cure and we'll light it up this should be cured enough where we want my son like this up you [Music] you [Music] for next one we're going to use some petroleum jelly and a tampons make sure you raise your wife's closet to find these Tiffany's right up great thing about tampon is they're primarily just cotton so we're going to take this spread it out a little bit take your petroleum jelly stick this down in there get it nice and moist on both sides of it I'll make sure you might want to either wipe your hands off really well before doing this or my case I may have my son reach in here and light this for me so I don't catch my own hand on fire so sometimes take a second or two to get that cotton on fire once you get it going though you see there it's a nice stable burn if you want it to burn a little faster you can always hold it up like so and you can really feel that starting to go let's get hot there you go tampon that's a protein gel [Music] next up we're going to use your q-tip or maybe just half a q-tip and some chapstick first we want to try and fluff up the q-tip a little bit so we want to get some of that cotton nice and exposed something along those lines there and we want to rub it and this chapstick or a bit I really good then you can take it in you can stick it down into the chapstick like so and we're going to like this thing up there we go looks a lot like a candle that's kind of what it is a chapstick candle [Music] all right next up what a lot of people have now is hand sanitizer let's put a little bit this on the tray now I'm going to use some paper to start this just for safety sake now it may not look like anything's going on in the hand sanitizer that's because it's basically a clear flame now watch this as I stick another piece of paper right near it boom instantaneous flame alright to show you that still going on up there so make sure if you're going to use hand sanitizer be very careful not to get to it if it's on fire or just make sure you get your hand similar near it like here I can feel the heat from it from this far away so make sure it is out before you get burned now we're going to give some chips a try open up your nice favorite type of chips my case it happens to be Pringles I'm going to show you how flammable these are Oh and that is a great way to get your fire started using your favorite snacks Oh next up we're going to peel an orange yes I said in orange now if you leave it out and let the peel will get nice and hard after a couple days of dry out you should be able to light this up sometimes this can be a little bit difficult to get started at first because of all the oils and liquids that are still inside but give it a moment of lighter there you go [Music] all right a lot of people forget when they have birthdays if you get the reliable candles these can also work great when you're trying to start a fire now that stone is going to light up these candles and a good thing there are a number of lighten up these candles is that sometimes it'll take a minute or two for the wick and the wax to really get going so if you can cover these up and keep them lit and give them just a few seconds sometimes they'll start to spark that'll be part of the way you can know that they're ready to be blown out if you give it a little sparks going on there now my son is going to give it a try blown out now here's the key to these candles are alight even though they look like they may be fully blown out given just a few seconds and they will relight even on the back there is a warning it says to put these out need to submerge them in water for up to 5 minutes so that way there is no chance of them relighting give them just a moment and boom that way that's a great way you're out in the wilderness if you can get these lips that you don't have to worry about the wind blowing them out [Music] you enjoyed this collection of
