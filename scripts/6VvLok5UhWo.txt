all right today i'm going to show you how to make fire using a piece of paper like this one and a magnifying lens so basically what you're gonna do is uh you're gonna roll this okay so easy for you to hold it in your hand like so and then uh make sure this is thick enough if it is not thick enough you can fold this in half first and then roll it okay but i think this is thick enough and it looks on any kind of paper um i just happen to have this this paper just for packing paper but you can use newspaper uh any other kind of pencil the darker the paper the better it is because uh it's uh absorb the sunlight better so i fold it like this and i'm gonna twist it okay i'm gonna twist it so that it doesn't come loose and then when i sign the light sunlight sign on it you basically create amber and you basically burn it so when you're shining it it instantly burns and turns into cold and you're gonna make a a large like a round area that's burning and then when it's big enough all you gotta do is to um wave the paper lightly like so so that increase the airflow and it's gonna catch fire okay and uh let me put the camera on the tripod and demonstrate it and i have to wear eye protection you need something like this because um this lens is very strong um under the sunlight the light is extremely bright and um you will need some protection for your eyes to protect your eyes all right i'm gonna put on a tripod i'm gonna show you all right i'm in the sun right now ready to uh try it and uh i have to wear this and once i put this on i can barely see anything so excuse me if i'm i look like a group around because i can barely see anything with this on but this is how you protect your eyes okay all right let's put this on all right let's try it now it's in the winter so the sun is all the way along the horizon but it's good enough i mean this lens is very powerful see the moment i put it on um you want a shine on the piece of paper it lights up i mean the smoke coming out immediately burns immediately i'm not sure you can see this but i'm trying to make um i make it a round circle i mean you know just trying to make ambers big enough so that i can i can have some fires so once i have a big enough amber i'm just gonna wave piece paper a little bit to increase airflow and then it will light up see the smoke coming out let's see it's gonna line up i am packing this too tight so it's losing it a little bit lots of smoke now there you go see the five there you go beautiful fire all right it took me probably about a minute or two and uh very fast pretty easy all right the fire is out let's see if we can restart it just give it some air so when it's burning you loosen this a little bit to increase the airflow and then it should burn right nicely all right that's all i have folks thank you for watching
