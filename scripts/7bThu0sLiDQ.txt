welcome to corporals corner today we're gonna Kass imple bow-drill so stick around a lot of times in life we tend to overcomplicate things in our jobs and doing skills like this the outdoors and that's our own doing for me I personally believe that you should play like it's real and get a wide variety of training in all types of environments along with that the types of materials that are produced or available in that environment so today's video is gonna be about a bow-drill and I was gonna do it well on cottonwoods because they're everywhere out here and back east I know everybody likes to use to a poplar so I wanted to try to show the difference between what we have and what they have and as I'm making my way towards the cottonwoods I see them off in the distance I have to go through this wash bed I looked around I saw this other materials laying around here and I said to myself this is a great time to practice the possum mentality that we talked about in several videos and that is seizing the opportunities that present themselves and taking advantage of the materials as you come across them because where you're going they might not be there and as I started collecting materials it dawned on me and I said to myself you know this is going to be too complicated not that I can't do it I've done it several times but why would I want to go to a cottonwood tree and produce all the parts for the bow sit there for half an hour carving everything out and make it all looking nice and pretty and then attempt to produce an ember when I have palm tree right over there I have seep willow or mule fat growing all through this wash and once again that's pasta mentality I can recognize those materials and I collect them so today's video I want to title it simple bow drill or easy bow drill not to say that friction fire is or that it will ever be easy because it's not but in reality if I didn't have any gear and I had to produce an ember using fire by friction what I want to go to the hardest tree I could find oh look is an oak tree let's go over there and try to make a bow drill set or what I say I know for a fact that a softwood is a palm branch and there's sea poo everywhere I could buy them get a hand drill or at least a bow drill going and produce an ember like this and that's good to go in my book now please don't confuse this with learning the easiest set to make and then go out there and think you're gonna do it every time you should train with juniper with Cottonwood with Aspen with - a poplar with oak because those materials might only be available where you're at but at the same time if you can take advantage of a situation and collect certain materials for future use that's pasamonte alley that's best it's thinking ahead so with that mindset of simplicity this next part of the video you have coming up is a simple or easy bow drill using materials off the landscape enjoy at this location right here we have a cottonwood on our left and we have veal fat or sea polo on our right it's a perfect location just for a bearing block as well as a spindle and it for identification purposes here's your leaves on your seat willow or mule fat once again the growing wash beds drainage ditches the full view of the Sun and they can collect and suck up that water I want try to find the straightest piece that I can the diameter that I want is the size of my thumb but no smaller than the size of my index finger once again for identification purposes that's what meal fat or seat willow looks like when I go ahead and cut this down so I want to rotate it find the straightest piece possible there's a small curvature to my left so I'm gonna go ahead and cut that piece off I want the length to be anywhere from my pinkie to my thumb now utilizing the safe cutting technique this is called a beaver - got the work out in front of me my hands closed like a fist I'm pushing into the material as I rotate my spindle what's uncomfortable I'm gonna flip the spin ball around do the exact same thing you'll watch pieces pop right off once again this is called a beaver - technique and when it's all said and done the piece should snap in half and you look at your spindle you notice one side the diameter is actually larger on that larger end you want to go ahead and round it off and on the opposite end go ahead and carve it to a taper okay so what I've done here they're taking a piece of cotton wood and just baton didn't have this is gonna be used for my handhold or bearing block sometimes referred to as a socket I'm gonna fit my hand over it just like that then just make a small indentation or depression in the approximate Center that with the tapered end of your spindle can fit right inside there and you can drill into your fire board now that we have our spindle and bearing block out of the way we can focus on our bow but was nothing more than a curved stick this one has a wide ratchet one end now the opposite end I wouldn't use the beaver too method and carved out it's a small area and that's what my bank line is gonna go ahead and tie off on the opposite end my tie a bowline now it's how a Boeing they do is rotate it over that's why I end up through that hole to get around the cordage back down through the hole grab my ends and pull it tight and that's a classic bowing the tails on the inside as farce pretty straightforward all you can do is wrap it around several times and then you hold on to your bow you want to place your finger on that area and apply pressure that way it won't slip here's enough footage from a previous video on the hand drill you have a palm branch in front of you right there find the straightest piece then go ahead and cut it and then start carving it down to resemble a 2x4 then is take my knife not like an indentation and this board right here happens to be the palm branch from our hand drill video next take my spindle these gently push down and twist it see a small divot right there and that should be good to go and now we're ready to see our drill and I should be good to go and all you I do is remove that material and you are moving anywhere from 25 to 30 percent into your indentation or your divot where you seated your drill now the last thing I want to do turn it over and I want to go ahead and carve out some material around the bottom this will allow some air flow to the Ember we blackened our tip our spindle that's all I'm gonna do here go ahead remove some of that material where you can see white that's not mandatory but it actually helps out it's got fresh material to burn you're good to go now taking my ember catch just like last time there's a piece of our palm branch I'll place it down on here put my board on top got my bow in my spindle I come up between the string and the bow then rotate it down in a way towards me and it should lock into place I rotate it down towards my hand it's my bearing block or socket onto my tapered end lock my wrist against my shin that might utilize the full length of my boat start off slow all we're doing is we're filling that nut powder and the amperage to pop itself right out welcome back that was good to go if you notice in a previous clip the fire board the palm branch actually was on fire they caught an ember and actually took an ember itself and actually destroyed itself so you can see there's disadvantages that using a palm branch for a bow drill but did it work yes and truth be told this and a yucca stock or my go to in the desert because you can get an ember I don't want to say it's guaranteed but it's pretty darn close as long as everything is completely dry suck about the spindle I showed you how to collect a seat below you want it no fatter than your thumb and no thinner or skinnier your index finger you want to run approximately your pinkie to your thumb in length tape or one end off and around the other the socket give me any piece of wood that's green this here is Cottonwood and your bow I prefer a Y branch at the end slight curve to it and number 36 bank line and once again no way in no way am I saying do this every time practice play like it's real get out there get experience with all types of woods and all touch environments take your comments view support and thanks for watching get out in the field have some fun I'll catch you next time [Music]
